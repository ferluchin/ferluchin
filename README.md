### Hello World! 👋
---

⚡ I am Luis Granda, from cold Loja, in the South of Ecuador (South America). I am an engineer, entrepreneur, programmer, and gamer.

💻 My code is mainly focused in 🌐 Web development: Front-End with JavaScript, and backend with Ruby on Rails, although I do a lot of this and that with other languages, frameworks, and tools.

💬 Ask me about anything related to coding, which is what I do for a living.
