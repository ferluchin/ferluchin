## Hello, I'm Luis Granda! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’»I'm a passionate software engineer from Loja, Ecuador with a love for programming, entrepreneurship, and gaming. 

My focus is mainly on web development, with extensive experience in both front-end technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and frameworks 
like React, and back-end technologies like Ruby on Rails. 
I have also worked with other languages, frameworks, and tools, and love to explore new technologies and techniques to solve problems.

I take great pride in my ability to solve complex problems and turn ideas into working applications. 
I believe in writing clean, maintainable code that not only works but is also scalable, and user-friendly.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the outdoors, or sharing my knowledge of coding through my social media platforms.
